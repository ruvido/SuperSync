# TODO

## Check consistency

Make an initial check if the STORAGE folder and LIGHTROOM template folder exist or not. If NOT the process should be stopped since the destination storage folder is missing (e.g. external drive disconnected)

## Message consistency

Log progress bar is inside the project class, while initial output messages are defined in the Messages class

## Create a customizable import dialog

That is, a way to change the naming of the project folder (useful for family)
